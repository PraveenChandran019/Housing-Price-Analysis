# Housing-Price-Analysis
## Executive Summary
Using housing price data and economic indicators, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the factors influencing housing prices in various cities across the USA over the past 20+ years. The analysis was powered by data retrieved through the FRED API, which provided essential economic indicators such as GDP, per capita income, and real interest rates. Key findings show that cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami experienced 4 times price increase, whereas cities like Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago saw 2 times increase. Nationally, housing prices increased 6 times. The analysis highlights the impact of these economic indicators on housing prices and provides actionable insights for investment, policy recommendations, and measures for real estate companies.
## Business Problem
Housing prices are crucial for both the real estate market and the broader economy. The increase in housing prices has led to a reduction in housing sales—a trend where higher prices result in decreased sales. Real estate investors need to take note of this trend as it impacts market dynamics and profitability. The goal is to identify the factors driving these price changes, understand their implications, and provide strategies for addressing affordability and improving market stability.
