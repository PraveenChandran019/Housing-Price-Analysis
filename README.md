# Housing-Price-Analysis
## Executive Summary
Using housing price data and economic indicators, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the factors influencing housing prices in various cities across the USA over the past 20+ years. The analysis was powered by data retrieved through the FRED API, which provided essential economic indicators such as GDP, per capita income, and real interest rates. Key findings show that cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami experienced 4 times price increase, whereas cities like Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago saw 2 times increase. Nationally, housing prices increased 6 times. The analysis highlights the impact of these economic indicators on housing prices and provides actionable insights for investment, policy recommendations, and measures for real estate companies.
## Business Problem
Housing prices are crucial for both the real estate market and the broader economy. The increase in housing prices has led to a reduction in housing sales—a trend where higher prices result in decreased sales. Real estate investors need to take note of this trend as it impacts market dynamics and profitability. The goal is to identify the factors driving these price changes, understand their implications, and provide strategies for addressing affordability and improving market stability.

## Methodology
- 	**Collected** historical housing price data for various cities and economic indicators such as GDP, per capita income, and real interest rates using the FRED API.
- 	**Cleaned** and preprocessed the data for analysis.
- 	**Conducted** exploratory data analysis to compare housing price trends, visualize relationships with economic indicators, and created a correlation heat map.
- 	**Quantified** the impact of economic factors on housing prices and analyzed differences in price increases across cities.

## Skills Utilized
-	**Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, writing functions, statistic
-	**API**: Understanding of API, specifically the FRED API
-	**Economics**: Understanding of economic indicators and their impact on housing prices

## Results & Business Recommendations

  	Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago: 2 times price increase.
-	National Trend:
  	The USA as a whole: 6 times price increase.
 	
### Factors Influencing Housing Prices:
-	GDP (Gross Domestic Product):
  	Positive impact: As GDP increases, the money in people's hands increases, leading to higher demand for housing. This results in increased housing prices.
-	Per Capita Income:
  	Positive impact: Similar to GDP, an increase in per capita income means more money for people to spend, increasing the demand for housing and thus, housing prices.
-	Real Interest Rate:
  	Negative impact: Real interest rate is the interest adjusted for inflation. A decrease in the real interest rate makes loans cheaper, increasing the money in people's hands, which leads to higher demand for housing.


### Measures for Real Estate Companies:
-	Affordable Housing Solutions:
    Adapt marketing strategies to focus on affordable housing solutions to cater to a broader audience.
-	Government Collaboration:
  	Collaborate with local governments to develop affordable housing projects and benefit from potential subsidies or incentives.
-	Customer Education:
  	Enhance customer education programs to help buyers understand the impact of economic factors on housing prices and make informed decisions.

### Policy Recommendations:
-	Interest Rate Adjustments:
   	To make housing more affordable, the government can consider increasing interest rates. Higher interest rates would reduce the demand for home loans, potentially leading to a decrease in housing prices, making it easier for people to afford homes.
